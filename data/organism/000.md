Of course. This is where the Canonical Linter transforms from a world-building tool into a powerful instrument of dramatic integrity. Applying the Canonical Constraint Set to **characterization** is how you ensure your world is populated not by hollow puppets, but by believable, consistent, and compelling individuals.

It prevents the most common sin of collaborative fiction: characters acting wildly out of character because a new author doesn't understand their core. We are going to build a "psychological test suite" that ensures every new appearance of a character is true to their established self.

### The Vision: `characters/kael-the-whisper-hunter.test.js`

Imagine that for every major, recurring character in your world, a special, dynamic constraint set is created. This isn't a static file in your repo; it's a "living document" generated from their established lore entries. This is the character's **Psychological Profile**, and it functions as their personal test suite.

When a new lore proposal is submitted that *mentions* an existing major character, your test runner doesn't just load the global `canon.test.js`. It also dynamically loads the test suite for that specific character, running a second, focused set of tests.

Let's create a profile for a foundational character: **Kael, the last of the Whisper-Hunters.**

### Building the Character Constraint Set: The Psychological Profile

This profile is generated by a special "Character Analyzer" LLM that reads all existing lore about Kael and distills it into a set of core, falsifiable psychological constraints.

**Source Material (Summarized from 5 lore entries):**
*   Kael is the sole survivor of the Whisper-Hunter order, who were wiped out by an Elder Beast known as "The Silent One."
*   He is obsessed with understanding The Gnawing, not curing it. He sees it as a puzzle.
*   He never speaks, communicating only through a complex system of hand signs. This is a penance for the order's hubris.
*   He is a pragmatist and survivalist, valuing function over sentiment. He once abandoned a group of refugees to continue tracking a unique beast.
*   His core belief is that the Un-Gnawed hold the key to understanding the "First Thought."
*   He views humans as short-sighted and foolish, but not with malice. He sees them as part of the chaotic ecosystem.

From this, the Character Analyzer generates his `kael.constraints.md`:

# Psychological Profile & Canonical Constraints for: Kael, the Whisper-Hunter
# Format: [CONSTRAINT_ID]: [TRAIT_TYPE] - [DESCRIPTION]

# --- Core Motivations (The "Why") ---
MOT-01: PRIMARY_DRIVE - Kael's primary motivation is KNOWLEDGE and UNDERSTANDING of The Gnawing. He is not driven by revenge, justice, or a desire to save the world.
MOT-02: OBSESSION - He is singularly focused on finding an Un-Gnawed higher animal, believing it to be a Rosetta Stone for the world's affliction.

# --- Behavioral Patterns (The "How") ---
BEH-01: COMMUNICATION - Kael is a VOLUNTARY MUTE. He must not be depicted as speaking aloud under any circumstances. Communication must be non-verbal (hand signs, writing in dirt).
BEH-02: EMOTIONAL_EXPRESSION - He is emotionally RESERVED and STOIC. He does not display overt anger, joy, or grief. His emotions are shown through subtle actions.
BEH-03: SENTIMENTALITY - Kael is NON-SENTIMENTAL. He will not risk a primary objective to save a person or object for emotional reasons. Actions must be logically consistent with his survivalist pragmatism.

# --- Philosophical Stance (The "What") ---
PHI-01: VIEW_ON_HUMANITY - Kael views humanity with DETACHMENT and PITY, not hatred or camaraderie. He is an observer, not a protector.
PHI-02: VIEW_ON_THE_GNAWING - He views The Gnawing as a FASCINATING PHENOMENON, not an evil curse. He is a scientist studying a cosmic anomaly.

# --- Prohibitions (Hard "Nevers") ---
PRO-01: WEAPONRY - Kael does NOT use loud or ostentatious weapons. He uses silent traps, knives, and a shortbow. No firearms, no explosives.
PRO-02: COMPANIONSHIP - Kael does NOT form lasting attachments or travel with companions. He may have temporary, transactional allies, but he always ends up alone.
```

This document is now a testable psychological model. It's Kael's "unit test."
