**PAGE 1**

**PANEL 1 (Large, Establishing Panel)**
**Setting:** EXT. KAI'MAN-HATTAN - THE GUTTERS DISTRICT - NIGHT (FB Sec 3.1, 5.4.1)
**Visuals:** A steady, miserable DRIZZLE falls, making the already grimy district glisten under the inconsistent glow of GATOR-FAT LAMPS. We are outside a dilapidated TANNERY (Ref: "Gloom" scene). Steam billows from vents, mingling with the rain and fog. SWAMP WARDEN JAX (40s, weary, cynical, wearing a long, stained gator-hide trench coat over his standard Warden uniform) stands under a leaking awning, the smoke from his cheap swamp-herb cigarillo curling into the damp air.
**CAPTION (Jax, Internal):** They call Kai'MAN-hattan the jewel of the bayou. A testament to civilization carved from the jaws of the 'Swamp Tyrant'.
**CAPTION (Jax, Internal):** From where I'm standing, it just looks like the guts of the beast. And tonight, we found another piece of offal.
**SFX (Rain):** PSSSHHHHHH
**SFX (Distant Foghorn):** BWAAAHHHMP

**PANEL 2**
**Setting:** INT. TANNERY - NIGHT
**Visuals:** The scene is grim. A massive tanning vat has been drained, revealing the body of a man, his expensive CULINARY GUILD robes (FB Sec 3.1) stained dark by the tanning solution. His face is a mask of horror. Jax crouches by the vat, examining the scene with a practiced eye, careful not to disturb anything.
**JAX (To his subordinate, OFF-PANEL):** Time of death?
**WARDEN (O.S.):** Hard to say, sir. The brine... it pickles things. But the Guild Master raised the alarm an hour ago. Said his best chef was missing.

**PANEL 3**
**Setting:** Jax looks up as a new figure enters the tannery. She is SERAPHINA (30s, elegant, composed, wearing the immaculate white and crimson robes of a high-ranking official from The Order of the Crimson Skewer – FB Sec 5.2.1). She seems utterly out of place in the filth.
**SERAPHINA (Voice crisp, cutting through the gloom):** Warden Jax. I was told I would find you here.
**JAX (Without looking up):** You found what's left of your chef, ma'am. Not much of a prize.

**PAGE 2**

**PANEL 1**
**Setting:** A two-shot. Seraphina looks down at the body, her expression unreadable. Jax studies her, not the corpse.
**SERAPHINA:** That is Master Chef Korbin. He was... a prodigy. The youngest ever to master the Thirteen Ritual Cuts of the 'Crimson Tail'. His hands were insured by the Guild for a fortune in polished scales.
**CAPTION (Jax, Internal):** Insured hands. Floating in a vat of hide-stripping acid. The irony is as thick as the stench in here.

**PANEL 2**
**Setting:** CLOSE UP on Seraphina's face. A flicker of something – not grief, but cold anger.
**SERAPHINA:** The Order of the Crimson Skewer wants this resolved. Quietly. And quickly. We are prepared to offer a significant retainer for your... discretion. On top of your official Warden's fee.
**JAX:** My discretion isn't for sale. My results are. Who wanted him dead?

**PANEL 3**
**Setting:** Seraphina hands Jax a small, heavy pouch that CLINKS.
**SFX (Pouch):** CHINK
**SERAPHINA:** In his world, Warden? Everyone. Ambition is the first ingredient in any great dish. And the most poisonous. Start with his rivals.

**PANEL 4**
**Setting:** Jax watches her leave. He looks at the pouch, then back at the body.
**CAPTION (Jax, Internal):** Rivals. In the Culinary Guilds, that's a list as long as a 'Swamp Tyrant's' spine.

**PAGE 3**

**PANEL 1**
**Setting:** Jax is now carefully examining the victim's hands, using a pair of bone tweezers. (Ref: `Forensic Guide`)
**JAX (To his subordinate):** No struggle. No broken nails. He went into the vat willingly... or he was unconscious first.

**PANEL 2**
**Setting:** CLOSE UP on what Jax has found. Underneath one of Korbin's fingernails is a tiny pinch of a fine, deep-orange POWDER. It seems out of place.
**JAX (Internal):** Tanning chemicals are gray and brown. The mud is black. What are you...?

**PANEL 3**
**Setting:** Jax carefully scrapes the powder into a small glass vial. He sniffs it cautiously. His eyes narrow.
**CAPTION (Jax, Internal):** I know that smell. Faint. Fiery, with a hint of citrus and rot. A spice rarer than a Gator-Baron's pardon.
**CAPTION (Jax, Internal):** Sunfire Pollen. Grows only on the Bitterscale Fungus that thrives on the backs of elder Obsidian Scale Alligators. (FB GDD Bestiary)

**PAGE 4**

**PANEL 1**
**Setting:** EXT. KAI'MAN-HATTAN - FLOATING MARKET - LATER (FB Sec 5.4.1)
**Visuals:** A chaotic, vibrant scene. A network of crowded piers and barges. The air is filled with the shouts of vendors and the smell of smoked gator, swamp fruit, and a hundred different spices. Jax, blending in, moves through the crowd.

**PANEL 2**
**Setting:** Jax approaches a dark, curtained-off stall. The sign above is a simple carving of a nose. This is a "Spice-Sniffer's" den.

**PANEL 3**
**Setting:** INT. SPICE-SNIFFER'S STALL - CONTINUOUS
**Visuals:** The interior is cramped and filled with thousands of small sacks and jars. An ancient, blind man known only as THE NOSE sits behind a low table.
**THE NOSE (Without looking up, his voice a dry rasp):** Swamp Warden. You smell of rain, cheap cigars, and death. A common combination. What do you need?

**PANEL 4**
**Setting:** Jax places the vial of orange powder on the table. The Nose leans forward, uncorks it, and takes a long, delicate sniff.
**THE NOSE:** Hmmm. Pot
