Thirteen Erpenthropes, men who become huge giant alligator humans during specific points of time, attempt to not use their power as they become more powerful 

*   **Alethic Constraints**
    *   Possible: Metamorphic transition into a therianthropic state. Growth of physical power in correlation with the temporal cycle.
    *   Impossible: Halting the transformation once initiated. Preventing the growth of power. Transmitting the condition to others.
    *   Necessary: The cyclical, time-bound nature of the transformation. The mandatory reversion to human form after the allotted period.
*   **Deontic Constraints**
    *   Permitted: Passive existence during transformation. Observation of the world without interaction. Self-defense against existential threats.
    *   Prohibited: Willful application of therianthropic strength. Destruction of property or life. Revelation of their nature to outsiders.
    *   Obligatory: Seclusion during the transformation cycle. Active suppression of innate predatory instincts. Mutual enforcement of the prohibition among the Thirteen.
*   **Axiological Constraints**
    *   Good: Restraint. Control. The preservation of the human mind within the transformed body. Secrecy that protects others.
    *   Bad: The use of power. The act of transformation itself, viewed as a corruption. The loss of self-control.
    *   Indifferent: The power itself, as a biological fact. The temporal cycle that triggers the event.
*   **Epistemic Constraints**
    *   Known: The certainty of the transformation cycle. The identities of the other twelve Erpenthropes. The escalating level of their own power.
    *   Unknown: The origin of the Erpenthrope condition. The ultimate purpose or limit of their power. Whether their self-imposed restraint can be maintained indefinitely.
    *   Believed: That their restraint is a sufficient safeguard for the world. That secrecy is their only means of survival. That their humanity is defined by the rejection of their power.
