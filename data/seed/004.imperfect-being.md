Apis houri, highly intellegent bees, save the lives of humans with their honey but one queen is irresponsible 

*   **Alethic Constraints**
    *   **Possible:** Humans can be cured of fatal conditions by *Apis houri* honey. A hive can collapse due to a queen's failure.
    *   **Impossible:** Humans cannot synthesize the curative honey. A bee cannot override a queen's direct pheromonal command.
    *   **Necessary:** A queen is necessary for a hive's honey production. Specific rare flora are necessary for the honey's potency.

*   **Deontic Constraints**
    *   **Permitted:** Humans are permitted to petition a queen for honey. A queen is permitted to refuse a petition if hive resources are critically low.
    *   **Prohibited:** A queen is prohibited from withholding honey for capricious reasons. Humans are prohibited from forcibly harvesting the honey.
    *   **Obligatory:** A queen has an obligation to manage honey production for the survival of both the hive and the dependent human population.

*   **Axiological Constraints**
    *   **Good:** A queen who ensures a surplus of honey. Symbiosis. Communal responsibility.
    *   **Bad:** A queen who hoards honey or neglects her duties. A human who attempts to enslave the bees. Individualism within the hive.
    *   **Indifferent:** The existence of non-curative honey from common flora. Human activities that do not affect the bees' habitat.

*   **Epistemic Constraints**
    *   **Known:** It is known that the honey cures. It is known that the queen controls the hive.
    *   **Unknown:** The origin of the *Apis houri*'s intelligence is unknown. The full consequences of a total hive collapse are unknown.
    *   **Believed:** It is believed by the bees that their queen is infallible. It is believed by the irresponsible queen that hoarding honey will grant her greater power.
