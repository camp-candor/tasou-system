An immortal being looking for freedom tasked with recording miracles between realms is bound by two entities, one incredibly sweet and the other one relentlessly energetic

Based on the world parameters you provided, the narrative modalities are as follows:

- **Alethic Constraints** (The laws of what can be)
  - **Possible:** Trans-realm observation and passage for the purpose of recording. Miraculous events that violate the local physics of a given realm. Sustained existence without biological decay.
  - **Impossible:** Personal death or cessation. Unilateral self-liberation. Ignoring a miracle designated for recording.
  - **Necessary:** The continued co-existence with the two binding entities. The occurrence of miracles. The act of recording.

- **Deontic Constraints** (The rules of what must be done)
  - **Permitted:** Passive observation of non-miraculous events. Travel along pre-established vectors between realms. Cataloging recorded data.
  - **Prohibited:** Interference with any miracle's unfolding or outcome. Inaccurate or emotionally-colored recording. Initiating contact with mortal beings beyond the scope of observation.
  - **Obligatory:** The complete and objective recording of all designated miracles. To receive and endure the Sweet entity's affection. To match and channel the Energetic entity's momentum.

- **Axiological Constraints** (The system of what is valued)
  - **Good:** Freedom from the binding. A perfect, complete record. Moments of unobserved solitude.
  - **Bad:** The binding itself. An incomplete or corrupted record. Actions that strengthen the binding.
  - **Indifferent:** The content or moral implication of the miracles themselves. The fates of the mortals who experience the miracles.

- **Epistemic Constraints** (The framework of what is known)
  - **Known:** The mechanics and signatures of all miracle types. The nature and demands of the binding entities. The precise location and time of the next miracle's manifestation.
  - **Unknown:** The origin of the binding entities. The ultimate purpose of the record. A verifiable method for achieving freedom.
  - **Believed:** That freedom is a possible, though currently unreachable, state. That the record serves a purpose beyond mere collection. That the two entities represent fundamental, irreconcilable cosmic principles.
