Celibate women sell T-shirts to fund rocket research while avoiding assassination 

*   **Alethic Constraints**
    *   **Possible:** Evasion of assassins. Funding of rocket research through T-shirt sales. Celibacy is maintainable.
    *   **Impossible:** Achieving mission goals without funding. Surviving a successful assassination.
    *   **Necessary:** Constant vigilance. Adherence to scientific principles for rocket research. Continuous commerce.
*   **Deontic Constraints**
    *   **Permitted:** Conducting research. Designing and selling T-shirts. Utilizing profits for the mission. Taking defensive measures.
    *   **Prohibited:** Sexual relations. Personal use of funds. Divulging mission-critical information.
    *   **Obligatory:** Maintaining celibacy. Advancing the rocket research. Protecting fellow members.
*   **Axiological Constraints**
    *   **Good:** The mission. Scientific progress. Group solidarity. Purity of purpose.
    *   **Bad:** Assassination attempts. Distraction from the mission. Betrayal.
    *   **Indifferent:** Public fashion trends. External social conventions not affecting the mission.
*   **Epistemic Constraints**
    *   **Known:** The scientific requirements of rocketry. The existence of a hostile force. The purpose of their mission.
    *   **Unknown:** The identity and full resources of the assassins. The timing of future attacks. The ultimate success or failure of the mission.
    *   **Believed:** The mission's importance outweighs personal sacrifice. The assassins represent an oppressive or ignorant ideology. Celibacy ensures focus.

    # Story World Codex: Shield & Thrust Protocol\n# Based on Doležel's Heterocosmica - *The Celestial Sewing Collective*\n\n**World:** *GILGAMESH VERTICAL* (Post-Gender Civil War Earth)  \n**Codex Version:** 0.3  \n**Core Constraint Thesis:** *When patriarchal systems weaponize reproduction rights, scientific progress becomes an act of revolutionary celibacy.*  \n\n---\n\n## I. Core Constraints  \n\n### **Alethic Modalities**  \n*Constraint ID: ALE-01*  \n**Rule:** Orbital mechanics/physics identical to Earth-prime (requiring rocket research to follow authenticated physics).  \n**Function:** Prevents techno-magical solutions; mandates authentic engineering struggle → *T-shirt revenue must fund actual rocket science.*  \n\n*Constraint ID: ALE-02*  \n**Rule:** Artificial wombs exist but are controlled by FUNDAMENTALIST COVENANTS (see Deontic). Biological pregnancy remains high-risk + easily monitored.  \n**Function:** Forces celibacy vows as only reliable contraceptive → *Bodies become political/scientific territory.*  \n\n### **Deontic Modalities**  \n*Constraint ID: DEO-01*  \n**Rule:** **Celibate Vow** (The Silent Compact): Forbidden romantic/sexual attachments while in the SEWING COLLECTIVE. Breaking vow = expulsion → loss of legal STEM protections.  \n**Function:** Creates *isolation* ➔ sisterhood tensions; forced sublimation into science/design.  \n\n*Constraint ID: DEO-02*  \n**Rule:** **FUNDAMENTALIST COVENANT LAW:** Women prohibited from advanced aerospace research. Punishment: **Kinetic Dissuasion** (assassination via orbital rods).  \n**Function:** Makes rocket research inherently lethal → fundraising must look innocuous (T-shirts!).  \n\n### **Axiological Modalities**  \n*Constraint ID: AXI-01*  \n**Taboo:** Openly discussing rocket science = \"Vulgar Verticality\". Approved terms: *Textile Physics, Sublime Stitching.*  \n**Function:** Encryption via craft-language → hidden equations in T-shirt patterns.  \n\n*Constraint ID: AXI-02*  \n**Sacred Value:** **Fabric as Armor.** A donated T-shirt = 1 favor owed by wearer; collective's signature shirts act as IFF tags against assassins.  \n**Function:** Social capital replaces money; fashion becomes tactical.  \n\n### **Epistemic Modalities**  \n*Constraint ID: EPI-01*  \n**Limit:** COVENANT surveillance AIs can't recognize covert science in *aesthetically pleasing* data → equations hide in fractal sewing patterns.  \n**Failure State:** Pattern recognized → geosynchronous tungsten rod strike within 8m.  \n**Function:** *Design = survival.* Every shirt risks annihilation.  \n\n*Constraint ID: EPI-02*  \n**Limit:** No Collective member knows all rocket components → distributed manufacturing via coded stitching instructions.  \n**Function:** Security through compartmentalization → requires absolute trust + precision.  \n\n---\n\n## II. Constraint-Driven Narrative Engines  \n\n### **Plots from Alethic Constraints**  \n- **ALE-01 + ALE-02:** Rocket math requires pregnancy-level caloric intake → black-market sale of *\"Temporary Womb\"* T-shirts (metabolic enhancers woven into fabric).  \n- **ALE-02 Violation:** Scientist secretly pregnant → must solve orbital equations before fetus's bio-signature alerts COVENANT drones.  \n\n### **Plots from Deontic Constraints**  \n- **DEO-01 Crisis:** Top engineer falls for coffee supplier → must choose between love or finishing NERVAPRINT design hidden in next shirt batch.  \n- **DEO-02 Exploit:** Flood market with *\"Orbital Drop Kinetic\"* meme shirts ➔ COVENANT wastes rods destroying pop-up stalls.  \n\n### **Plots from Axiological Constraints**  \n- **AXI-01 Opportunity:** Fashion blogger decodes *Sublime Stitching* → becomes unwitting propaganda vector for launch equations.  \n- **AXI-02 Betrayal:** Rival Collective counterfeits armor-shirts → wearers marked for assassination.  \n\n### **Plots from Epistemic Constraints**  \n- **EPI-01 Ticking Clock:** Surveillance AI starts appreciating avant-garde fashion → Collective must *dumb down* designs to survive.  \n- **EPI-02 Fragmentation:** Lead scientist dies → last shirt holds partial thruster code; survivors must reconstruct math from fan merch knockoffs.  \n\n---\n\n## III. Constrained Characterization  \n\n### **Prototype Roles**  \n1. *The Silent Seamstress*  \n   - **Properties:** Tactile calculus (solves equations via fabric tension), vow-bound muteness  \n   - **Constraint Leverage:** Embroiders rocket code as \"decorative flaws\" → EPI-01 evasion  \n   - **Tragedy:** Cannot verbally warn sisters of approaching assassins → only through aggressive knitting  \n\n2. *The Virgin Accountant*  \n   - **Properties:** Laundry-based cryptography, celibacy-enforced emotional transparency  \n   - **Constraint Leverage:** Hacks COVENANT tax codes via T-shirt QR donations  \n   - **Tragedy:** *True* rocket costs require selling 4.2M shirts ➔ compulsive dataism destroys art  \n\n### **Antagonist Dynamics**  \n- **COVENANT Assassin (Deontic Enforcer):**  \n  - Must publicly buy + wear target's last shirt before rod strike (AXI-02 honor code)  \n  - **Weakness:** Can't resist merch drops of *limited editions* → delays kills  \n\n---\n\n## IV. Believability Safeguards  \n\n### **Consistency Checks**  \n- **Newtonian Physics (ALE-01):** Every rocket test shows authentic failure modes → no \"magic\" thrusters  \n- **Silent Compact (DEO-01):** Broken vows *always* cause expulsion → no heroic exceptions  \n- **Fabric Armor (AXI-01):** 1 shirt ≠ bulletproof → only delays rods via IFF ping confusion  \n\n### **Immersion Killers**  \n- **Violation:** Scientist has biological child *without* plot leveraging ALE-02 womb-tech scarcity  \n- **Solution:** Character uses T-shirt loom to weave temporary placental matrix ➔ resource-intensive, attracts hunters  \n\n---\n\n## V. Identity Through Limitation  \n\n**Constraint Cluster:** *Celibacy + Fashion-Funding + Kinetic Assassination*  \n- **Creative Focus:**  \n  - Rocket science through *textile* metaphors (warp drives = \"missed stitches\")  \n  - Fundraising as *performative* mundanity → pop-up shops become death-defying rituals  \n- **Unique World Identity:**  \n  - **\"Screaming Silently at Escape Velocity\"**  \n  - Where *cotton* is revolutionary → every shirt a manifesto, a shield, a fuel equation  \n```","refusal":null,"reasoning":"\nAlright, let's break down this user's request. They want me to replace the markdown template with content focused on a specific story world where celibate women sell T-shirts to fund rocket research while avoiding assassination. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core elements: celibacy, fundraising through merchandise, rocket science, and assassination threats.
