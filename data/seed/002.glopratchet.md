Intelligent Glops are naturally drawn to each other
but if too many inhabitant the same space they cause a catastrophe

- **Alethic Constraints**
  - Possible: Limited aggregation in dyads or triads.
  - Impossible: Permanent isolation; resisting the Confluence Drive indefinitely.
  - Necessary: The Confluence Drive; catastrophic energy release (The Rupture) upon reaching critical density.
- **Deontic Constraints**
  - Permitted: Solitude; ritualized, temporary contact.
  - Prohibited: Formation of large clusters; establishment of permanent settlements.
  - Obligatory: Dispersion upon detection of pre-Rupture phenomena; exile of hyper-attractive individuals.
- **Axiological Constraints**
  - Good: Equilibrium; distance; managed separation.
  - Bad: Density; aggregation beyond the threshold; The Rupture.
  - Indifferent: Non-sentient matter; uninhabited space.
- **Epistemic Constraints**
  - Known: The Confluence Drive is immutable. The Rupture is inevitable at critical density.
  - Unknown: The precise numerical or spatial threshold of The Rupture. The location of all other Glop clusters.
  - Believed: Certain materials or energies can dampen the Confluence Drive. A state of perfect, stable balance is achievable.
