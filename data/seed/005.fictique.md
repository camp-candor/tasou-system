A Sasquatch tries to stay undetectable from government authorities 
as he looks for a missing mate

*   **Alethic Constraints**
    *   **Possible:** To communicate with other cryptid species; to use infrasound for long-distance signaling; to mimic natural phenomena (e.g., wind, shadow) for camouflage; to possess limited comprehension of human technology (drones, sensors) as direct threats.
    *   **Impossible:** To become truly invisible; to utilize complex human technology; to communicate directly with humans via language; to exist without leaving any physical trace.
    *   **Necessary:** To maintain constant sensory vigilance; to forage for sustenance; to adhere to ancient, unmarked pathways to avoid human infrastructure.

*   **Deontic Constraints**
    *   **Permitted:** To leave ritualistic trail markers for the mate; to observe humans from extreme distances; to use controlled force against non-human predators.
    *   **Prohibited:** To initiate contact with any human; to enter human settlements except under cover of extreme weather; to make vocalizations within audible range of human activity; to kill a human unless under direct threat to self or mate.
    *   **Obligatory:** To erase all tracks near human-patrolled zones; to prioritize the search for the mate above personal safety; to aid another of his kind in distress.

*   **Axiological Constraints**
    *   **Good:** Undisturbed wilderness; the scent of kin; seclusion; finding a trace of the mate.
    *   **Bad:** The scent of humans and machinery; firearms, nets, and tracking devices; deforestation; capture.
    *   **Indifferent:** Natural weather cycles; the specific activities of humans not posing a direct threat; non-predatory wildlife.

*   **Epistemic Constraints**
    *   **Known:** The government actively hunts his species; the location of traditional safe territories; the signs and language of his own kind; the immediate threat posed by human proximity.
    *   **Unknown:** The mate's current location and status; the full capability of the government's tracking technology; the ultimate motive of the human authorities (study vs. extermination).
    *   **Believed:** The mate is alive and is also searching or leaving signs; ancient forest spirits offer protection; capture is a fate worse than death.
