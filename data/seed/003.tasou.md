Spider vampires are responsible for keeping the slimes apart for the cosmic cows
but care the most about soap drama occurring on a certain alligator earth

- **Alethic Constraints**
  - **Possible:** Inter-dimensional web-weaving; perception of alligator-earth media; slime-herding.
  - **Impossible:** Slime self-replication; survival in direct cosmic cow effluence; ignoring a cliffhanger.
  - **Necessary:** Slime merging in the absence of intervention; cosmic cow dependency on slime separation.
- **Deontic Constraints**
  - **Permitted:** Obsessive consumption of alligator soap operas; intricate analysis of character motivations; neglecting non-essential cosmic maintenance for viewing parties.
  - **Prohibited:** Allowing slimes to merge; revealing soap opera spoilers before a communal viewing; questioning the Cosmic Cow Mandate.
  - **Obligatory:** Maintaining the slime-separation barrier; participating in post-episode discussions.
- **Axiological Constraints**
  - **Good:** A perfect, gossamer-thin separation web; deep, insightful commentary on alligator romance arcs; emotional investment in fictional alligator lives.
  - **Bad:** A sloppy, thick web; slime contamination; cultural ignorance of soap opera canon.
  - **Indifferent:** The cosmic cows' subjective experience; the ultimate fate of the slimes beyond their separation.
- **Epistemic Constraints**
  - **Known:** The broadcast schedule of "Gator General"; the tensile strength of cosmic silk; the precise emotional trigger for a specific alligator character's dramatic crying fit.
  - **Unknown:** The true nature and origin of the Cosmic Cows; why the slimes must be kept apart.
  - **Believed:** That the alligator actors are involved in real-life scandals mirroring the show; that a particular slime shivers because it misses another slime.
