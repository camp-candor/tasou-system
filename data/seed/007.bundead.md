A witch creates undead bunnies to help with her loneliness
from wanting to be alone
which only brings attention to herself

- **Alethic Constraints**
  - **Possible:** Lapine necromancy. The simulation of companionship through magical constructs. Unavoidable social attention as a consequence of unnatural acts.
  - **Impossible:** True companionship from the undead. The reversal of the primary magical act. Lasting, peaceful solitude once the act is complete.
  - **Necessary:** The undead constructs attract external notice. The witch's core action produces its opposite and intended outcome. The persistence of her loneliness.

- **Deontic Constraints**
  - **Permitted:** Self-imposed isolation. The private practice of magic.
  - **Prohibited:** Necromancy (by external society). Social contact (by the witch).
  - **Obligatory:** Adherence to the witch's own ideal of solitude. Servitude of the undead constructs. Investigation of unnatural phenomena (by outsiders).

- **Axiological Constraints**
  - **Good:** Solitude (as an ideal). The creation of companions (as a perceived solution).
  - **Bad:** Loneliness (as a state). Unwanted attention. The perversion of natural life cycles.
  - **Indifferent:** The moral status of the undead bunnies. The natural world prior to its disruption.

- **Epistemic Constraints**
  - **Known:** The method of small-animal reanimation. The witch’s reclusive reputation. The existence of the unnatural creatures.
  - **Unknown:** The true nature of the bunnies (to outsiders). The witch’s foundational internal conflict. The ultimate cost of the magic.
  - **Believed:** The witch believes constructs can cure loneliness. Outsiders believe the bunnies are curiosities or threats. The witch believes she can control all consequences.
