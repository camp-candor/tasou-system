On alligator earth,
Cows are no longer eaten and are respected greatly
but all the worlds meat comes from the regenerating sun powered alligators

- **Alethic Constraints**
  - **Possible:** Alligators regenerate flesh and limbs via photosynthesis. Sustaining global populations on a single, regenerating meat source. Harvesting tissue from a living creature without causing its death.
  - **Impossible:** Alligator regeneration without solar exposure. The depletion of the meat supply, barring solar catastrophe. The slaughter of a cow for sustenance.
  - **Necessary:** Alligators require access to direct sunlight for regeneration. Cows must be permitted to exist without threat of consumption. Human society must manage the solar alligator farms.
- **Deontic Constraints**
  - **Permitted:** The regulated harvesting of alligator tissue. The veneration and care of cows. Development of solar-regeneration technologies.
  - **Prohibited:** Bovicide; the harming or killing of a cow. Consumption of beef or any bovine product. Obstructing an alligator's solar access ("Sun-blocking"). Waste of harvested alligator meat.
  - **Obligatory:** To protect any cow from harm. To maintain the solar alligator habitats ("Solariums"). To report any instance of Bovicide.
- **Axiological Constraints**
  - **Good:** The Cow (symbol of peace, history, and restraint). The Sun (source of all sustenance). Regeneration. Sustainability. Compassion toward bovines.
  - **Bad:** Wastefulness. Cruelty. Gluttony. Nostalgia for pre-alligator-era meats. Disrespect for cows.
  - **Indifferent:** The Alligator (viewed as a utility, a biological machine). Non-carnivorous diets. Pre-alligator history (viewed as primitive but not inherently evil).
- **Epistemic Constraints**
  - **Known:** The scientific principles of helio-saurian regeneration are established fact. The historical records of the "Time of Slaughter" before the rise of solar alligators detail ecological collapse.
  - **Unknown:** The origin of the solar alligators (evolution, bio-engineering, intervention). The subjective experience or consciousness of the alligators. The long-term effects of a mono-meat diet on human evolution.
  - **Believed:** Cows possess a sacred spirit or collective consciousness. The current system is a cosmic balance or covenant. To consume beef would trigger ecological and spiritual ruin.
