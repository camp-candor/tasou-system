An artist revives gifts from two supernatural beings 
who also torment enough to prevent him 
from winning a world art championship

*   **Alethic Constraints**
    *   **Possible:** Creation of art that violates physical laws. Communication with the supernatural entities.
    *   **Impossible:** Perfect, stable control over the gifted abilities. Winning the championship. Severing the connection to the entities.
    *   **Necessary:** The use of the supernatural gifts to create competitive art. The manifestation of torment as a chaotic flaw in the final work.

*   **Deontic Constraints**
    *   **Permitted:** To enter competitions using the gifted abilities.
    *   **Prohibited:** To reveal the source of the gifts. To create a flawless masterwork for the final judgment. To refuse the act of creation.
    *   **Obligatory:** To accept both the gifts and the torment. To compete in the championship.

*   **Axiological Constraints**
    *   **Good:** The act of creation. The transcendent quality of the art produced. The artist's struggle (to the entities).
    *   **Bad:** The artist's loss of control. The inevitable failure to win. The artist achieving peace (to the entities).
    *   **Indifferent:** The art world's judgment criteria. The entities' valuation of human ambition.

*   **Epistemic Constraints**
    *   **Known:** The artist knows the source of his abilities and his torment. The art world knows his work is brilliant yet unstable.
    *   **Unknown:** The ultimate motive of the supernatural beings. The precise mechanism of the torment's manifestation.
    *   **Believed:** The artist believes he can overcome the torment. The world believes his flaws are psychological.


    *   **Alethic Constraints**
    *   **Possible**: Channeling latent supernatural energy into artistic creation. Psychic and material torment originating from a non-corporeal source. Creation of transcendent art.
    *   **Impossible**: Winning the world art championship while under the patrons' influence. Severing the bond with the patrons without losing the gifts.
    *   **Necessary**: A connection to the supernatural patrons for creative acts of genius. The experience of torment as a byproduct of activating the gifts.

*   **Deontic Constraints**
    *   **Permitted**: Use of the supernatural gifts for creation. Participation in worldly competitions.
    *   **Prohibited**: Disclosure of the supernatural source of the gifts. Attributing creative power solely to mortal skill.
    *   **Obligatory**: The creation of art using the provided gifts. Endurance of the patrons' torment as a condition of the pact.

*   **Axiological Constraints**
    *   **Good**: Artistic creation that channels the supernatural. The manifestation of the supernatural gifts.
    *   **Bad**: The patrons' psychological and physical torment. Failure to create.
    *   **Indifferent**: The world art championship and its secular judges. Personal ambition for worldly fame.

*   **Epistemic Constraints**
    *   **Known**: The supernatural origin of the artistic gifts is known to the artist. The transcendent quality of the resulting artwork is known to the public and judges.
    *   **Unknown**: The ultimate motive of the supernatural patrons. The mechanism for ending the torment without losing the gifts.
    *   **Believed**: The artist believes he can manage the torment and win. The public and judges believe the artist's ability is a form of unstable, natural genius.
